<h1>Course project</h1>

<h2>Overall</h2>

Overall the course project was quite nice to do, since it was quite refreshing to create something you already knew how create before hand. Because of that before-hand exprience I chose to use Typescript for this project because I had very little experience with it but I had seen the tooling be very helpfull thing in other people projects.
