Notes for NODE.JS learning module

- Used most of the path module's methods
    - Like join and basename
    - Overall quite basic stuff

- Some of the fs module's methods were ones I have used before
    and it was good to refresh my memory on those. Methods were 
    quite easy to use and understand and the VSCode intellisense
    is a helpfull tool when not quite sure what the method in question
    does.

- Os module was quite simple one. I had used similar modules and libraries
    in other languages that are quite similar to this one. I felt it was quite 
    easy to use and it was really intuitive too.


- I had not used the url module before. It seemed quite useful and fun to use
    considering Js's close relation to web. Module was quite intuitive to use.
