I had used express quite a bit before this course. I had created similar apis for my projects.
For the most part this module was going through the same things that I had watched and learned before.
The only thing that I hadn't used before was handlebars. I had used templating engine before with python's Jinja but 
never with JavaScript because of the React and Vue like frameworks.
